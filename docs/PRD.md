# CycleTime - Intelligent Project Orchestration Platform PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Summary

**Product Name**: CycleTime  
**Product Type**: Intelligent Project Orchestration Platform with MCP Integration  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Document Owner**: John Burbridge  
**Last Updated**: July 17, 2025

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Engineering teams of any size, from enterprises to solo founders, struggle to maintain alignment and deliver consistent results as projects scale in complexity. Technology leaders face critical challenges: coordinating across multiple developers with varying workflows, maintaining project coherence as teams grow, and ensuring deliverable accuracy without forcing tool standardization that reduces developer productivity. The manual process of breaking down requirements into actionable development plans is inconsistent across teams, and project documentation often becomes stale or disconnected from actual development work, leading to context loss and miscommunication that compounds with team size.

**AI Agent Context Window Limitations**: While AI tools can assist with individual development tasks, they face critical limitations when working with large, complex software projects. AI agents frequently lose crucial project context due to conversation length constraints, context switching between different tools and sessions, and inability to efficiently access comprehensive project documentation. This leads to agent hallucination, inconsistent recommendations, and decisions that don't align with broader project goals and architectural constraints. Developers find themselves repeatedly re-explaining project context, significantly reducing the productivity gains that AI assistance should provide.

**Parallel Development Coordination Challenges**: When multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously, teams struggle with coordination overhead and integration risks. Without clear system boundaries, API contracts, and dependency mappings defined upfront, developers often create incompatible implementations that require expensive late-stage refactoring. Traditional project management tools focus on task assignment but fail to address the technical coordination needed for parallel development. Teams resort to frequent meetings, shared documents, and informal communication to coordinate interfaces and dependencies, leading to bottlenecks, blocked developers, and integration surprises that derail project timelines.

**Development Standards Consistency Challenges**: Engineering teams struggle to maintain consistent code quality and development practices across projects and team members. While static analysis tools and linters catch syntax issues, they cannot enforce team-specific practices like Test-Driven Development cycles, architectural patterns, documentation standards, or nuanced code review requirements. Human code review becomes the primary mechanism for standards enforcement, creating bottlenecks and inconsistent application of team practices. New team members lack guidance on team-specific conventions, and AI coding assistants operate without awareness of established team standards, leading to code that technically works but doesn't align with team practices and architectural decisions.

Currently, there's no integrated solution that maintains living documentation in the repository while intelligently orchestrating the entire project lifecycle from requirements analysis to task completion, specifically addressing the context window management challenges that prevent reliable AI agent collaboration, the technical coordination challenges that prevent efficient parallel development, and the standards enforcement challenges that prevent consistent development practices in software development.

### 1.3 Solution Overview

CycleTime is an intelligent project orchestration platform that enhances team collaboration and developer experience through AI-assisted project planning. The platform keeps humans in control of all critical decisions while leveraging the best of AI to improve planning efficiency and team coordination. CycleTime specifically addresses AI agent context window limitations through repository-centric documentation and intelligent context management, enabling reliable human-AI collaboration across extended development cycles.

The platform provides flexible AI model selection with support for leading providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more) for planning and analysis tasks, while supporting integration with popular AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, JetBrains AI, etc.) for code-specific assistance during development. Through advanced context window management via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), CycleTime ensures that AI agents maintain consistent access to relevant project information without overwhelming their processing capabilities or causing hallucinations due to context loss.

By analyzing Markdown-formatted requirements documents stored in the project repository and providing AI-powered assistance through your chosen AI models, CycleTime creates a seamless connection between documentation, planning, and execution that both humans and AI agents can access throughout the project lifecycle, with intelligent context prioritization that scales from simple features to complex, multi-month projects. The platform supports both monorepo and polyrepo architectures, with the MVP implementation focusing on monorepos for streamlined initial deployment.

### 1.4 Context Window Management Strategy

**Core Challenge**: AI agents working on software projects face significant limitations due to context window constraints. When agents lose access to crucial project context—whether due to conversation length limits, context switching between tools, or incomplete documentation access—they tend to hallucinate, make incorrect assumptions, or provide suboptimal recommendations that don't align with project requirements.

**CycleTime's Approach**: 

**Repository-Centric Context Persistence**: Unlike conversation-based AI interactions that lose context over time, CycleTime maintains all project context in versioned repository documentation. This ensures that both human team members and AI agents can access complete, up-to-date project information at any point in the development lifecycle.

**Intelligent Context Retrieval**: Through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, local AI tools can request specific project context with semantic search capabilities. Rather than overwhelming agents with entire documentation sets, CycleTime provides targeted, relevant context based on the current task and conversation scope.

**Layered Context Architecture**:
- **Immediate Context**: Current task specifications and directly related documentation
- **Project Context**: Overall project goals, architecture decisions, and milestone status  
- **Historical Context**: Previous decisions, completed tasks, and lessons learned
- **Cross-Reference Context**: Related tasks, dependencies, and impact analysis

**Context Window Optimization**: CycleTime automatically prioritizes and structures context delivery to maximize agent effectiveness within token limits, ensuring critical information reaches agents while filtering out noise that could lead to confusion or hallucination.

This strategy transforms AI agent reliability from a best-effort interaction to a systematic, context-aware collaboration that maintains project coherence across extended development cycles.
